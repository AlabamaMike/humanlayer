- 'c' on session table doesn't launch the session creator
- selecting "create new session" from the cmd+k launch takes me to a blank screen
- search view still doesn't work - the max height should be 80% of the screen height, and only display as many items as can fit
- selecting a session from the search view should navigate to the session details
